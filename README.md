# Programming & Scripting Data Analysis Project of Iris Flower Data Set

## Abstract Background Information of the Iris data set - 

In 1936 a study was first published by Ronald Fisher in the paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems".

This data set is now widely known & analysed in studies in various areas such as pattern recognition literature, machine learning, statistics, data mining & various other fields [4]. The data set is preferred for testing projects in these fields as the attributes are numeric and in the same units, which means loading and handling the data are required but no special scaling is required, it is a multi-classification problem, which allows for testing of learning algorithms & specialised handling and its size, only containing 4 attributes & 150 rows.

The data set itself describes particular biological characteristics of various sample Iris flowers. The study contains data relating to three classes of iris flowers – Iris Setosa, Irisa Versicolour & Iris Virginica, with fifty instances of each class analysed in the study.

The analysis of each instance calculates the – sepal length, sepal width, petal length & petal width. Generally the data set is analysed to test algorithms developed to classify the type of iris flower based on the measurements provided. Previous studies completed on the data set have determined that each class is linearly separable from the other two [6].
